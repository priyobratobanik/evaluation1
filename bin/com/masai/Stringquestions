if it is mutable then it creates more memory that is not good for programming.

 2.a.String in java is immutable but Stringbuffer in java is mutable.
 b.String class is slower while performing concentration operation where Stringbuffer is faster 
 while performing concentration operation.
 c.all methods are not syncrhonized in String class but all methods are syncrhonised in Stringbuffer class.
